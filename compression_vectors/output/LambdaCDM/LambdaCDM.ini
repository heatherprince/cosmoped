# param_name; fiducial value; make compression vector (1 or 0); order (0,1,2,...)
# if there is just a fiducial value, not an order, then the fiducial value will
# be used in finding the compression vectors, but a compression vector for that
# parameter will not be computed
# if make compression vector is 1 but an order isn't given the order of the
# parameters in the file will be used
#TODO: make it use Planck best fit if the fiducial value is not given
#TODO: name consistency with planck params/cosmosis params or code to convert
#TODO: include all planck parameters
#maybe include errors
